\begin{abstract}
As set in the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 \cite{1}, CO2 reduction will be a major target for the OECD nations in the near future. Even though electric vehicles [EV] could play a big factor in achieving that goal, their sales are strikingly low in Germany. Only 0.39\% of new car registrations were EVs in 2015 \cite{2}. 

Compared to Norway the leading country in Europe when it comes to PEV market share of total new car sales, was 22.39\% in 2015 \cite{abstract-3}. The total number of light-duty plug-in electric vehicle stock in Germany, therefore increased from 25,205 \cite{abstract-1} in 2014 to 48,669 in 2015 \cite{abstract-2} which already is an important step towards a more sustainable transport system in Germany. A reason why the numbers in Germany are so low, are most likely due to the fact that enormous barriers to adoption persist especially when it comes to longer journeys.

That is due to a decisive disadvantage of EVs, their generally low range of 250km or less. Even though continuous effort is made to increase battery capacity, and therefore the range of EVs, it seems that the range will even in the near feature be the limiting factor.

In order to still efficiently travel long distances of 500 km and upwards, Victor del Razo and Hans- Arno Jacobsen outlined a method in their paper ``Smart Charging Schedules for Highway Travel with Electric Vehicles'' for scheduling charging stops on a highway, such that the total travel time is minimized \cite{driver-17}.

They developed a simulation framework that is in need of a graphic interface for the manager of the simulation. Additionally, a UI for the EV driver is required. It should display certain information, such as the EV's current position on the map or the upcoming charging stations, to which it will display directions.

Therefore, this work comprises two prototypes for the respective frontends: a driver user interface [DUI] and a simulation manager user interface [SMUI].
