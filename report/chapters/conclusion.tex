The DUI is currently still under development. The components which are described in this paper are all implemented, furthermore are the screenshots provided showing a state of the art running system. Its is not a design sketch or a mock up, what so ever the user interface, as it is right now is still incomplete as already outlined.

Since some features are only implemented as ‘proof of concept’ and need to be completed in order to get a user interface that could be used for a case study. As an example the integration to the back end or the turn by turn navigation. Since we payed a lot of attention to generic programming style and due to the fact that the biggest parts are already implemented we are confident that progress can be made quite quickly.

The biggest challenge that has yet to come is the integration with the backend, but we are confident that due to our generic programming style this can be done with not too much effort.

Furthermore, there are currently features implemented as ``state of the art'' which need to be implemented as soon as a connection to the back end is done. For an example retrieving the waypoints for the charging stations and based on those retrieving the route from Here Maps.

In addition, there are some features which then would be beneficial to be added, like turn by turn navigation on screen.
