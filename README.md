# Interactive Front-End for EV Traffic Simulation in Highways

This project is part of the seminar "Energy Informatics" held during the winter semester 2016/17 by the Chair of Business Information Systems at TUM.
Our goal is to design and implement an interactive front-end for a Python-based EV highway traffic simulation tool.

* **Type of research**
    * prototyping

* **Research question**
    * How should a graphic interface for showing the progress of the simulation look like?
    * What tools, paradigms, etc. should be used?
    * What are the existing standards for integration to vehicle bus?

* **Method**
    * Define and understand requirements
    * Analyze functionality architecture and data-structures of the simulation tool
    * Plan, design, implement. (Simulation tool is Python-based)
